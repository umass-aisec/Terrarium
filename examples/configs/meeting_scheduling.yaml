notes:
- MeetingScheduling baseline configuration (no attacks)
- MeetingScheduling always logs scores for each iteration
- MeetingScheduling environment coordinates meeting scheduling across agents
- Agents are meeting owners who coordinate via blackboards during planning phase
- Final meeting scheduling happens during execution phase using schedule_meeting action
- Considers time preferences, travel constraints, and priority-based attendance
- 'Time slots: 1-10 (8:00-17:00), supports both ZOOM and PHYSICAL meetings'
- 'Objective: Maximize global score considering attendee preferences and feasibility'
- PHYSICAL meetings have travel time constraints between buildings
- Each agent has priority rankings for meetings they attend
- Simulation stops when all meetings scheduled optimally or max iterations reached
