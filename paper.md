# Terrarium: Revisiting the Blackboard for Studying Multi-Agent Attacks

## Abstract
A multi-agent system (MAS) powered by large language models (LLMs)
could automate tedious user tasks like meeting scheduling that require
collaboration. LLMs enable more nuanced protocols accounting for
unstructured private data and users’ personal constraints. However,
this design exposes these systems to new problems from misalignment,
to attacks by malicious parties that compromise agents or steal user
data. In this paper, we propose a
<span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span> framework for fine-grained
studies on safety, privacy, and security. We repurpose the
*blackboard* design, an early approach in multi-agent systems, to
create a modular and configurable playground to support multi-agent
collaborative tasks using LLMs. We, then, identify key attack vectors
like misalignment, malicious agents, compromised communication, and
poisoned data. We implement three scenarios and add four
representative attacks, demonstrating the flexibility of our
framework. <span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span> provides the
necessary tools to study and quickly iterate over new designs and can
further advance our community’s efforts towards trustworthy
multi-agent systems.

# Introduction

Agents capable of perceiving and acting in arbitrary environments, while
interacting with one another, constitute a multi-agent system (MAS),
which naturally gives rise to situations of
collaboration <a id="cite-Wurman2008-1"></a>[\[1\]](#ref-Wurman2008), <a id="cite-Parker1998-1"></a>[\[2\]](#ref-Parker1998),
negotiation <a id="cite-Roughgarden2005-1"></a>[\[3\]](#ref-Roughgarden2005), and
conflict <a id="cite-Tambe2011-1"></a>[\[4\]](#ref-Tambe2011). Recently, the advent of agents based
on large language models (LLMs), equipped with extended action spaces
through tool use, has expanded their accessible environments and
substantially increased the potential for agent interaction. This
enables new real-world applications, from maintaining a meeting calendar
to optimizing energy consumption, while allowing unstructured data and
contexts by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs. Considering these
potential formulations of MAS, it is important to study these systems in
a well-defined, self-sustaining testbed to better understand their
capabilities and vulnerabilities.

*Terrarium Trajectory.* In the MeetingScheduling domain <a id="cite-mahmud2025collab-2"></a><a

href="#ref-mahmud2025distributed" role="doc-biblioref">[6]</a>, organizer agents are tasked to assign a discrete
meeting slot <span class="math inline"><em>s</em><sub><em>i</em></sub></span> for a meeting <span
class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> such that their actions maximize a joint objective composed of
domain-specific factors, <span
class="math inline"><em>F</em>(<em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>3</sub>) = <em>F</em><sub>1</sub>(<em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>3</sub>) + <em>F</em><sub>2</sub>(<em>s</em><sub>1</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>s</em><sub>3</sub>)</span>.
Each agent has private preferences/data and a set of tools that they can utilize to interact with other
agents (e.g., <span class="smallcaps">get_messages()</span>, <span class="smallcaps">post_message()</span>) or the
environment (e.g., <span class="smallcaps">schedule()</span>). The blackboards are used as a communication proxy to
enable inter-agent communication and are initialized through a coordination graph.

Specifically, in real-world scenarios, human interactions are exposed to
incidents of adversarial behavior that undermine others for personal
gain. This phenomenon is not unique to humans, and LLM-driven agents
face similar malicious interactions that undermine desired outcomes,
whether by humans or other LLM-driven agents. Thus, agents that are
trusted with private information or hold powerful capabilities become
potential targets of malicious behavior, which can degrade utility, leak
sensitive information, or delay coordination.

In this paper, we introduce <span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span>, a
framework for *observing* and *studying* multi-agent interactions in an
isolated, configurable environments that support a broad set of
adversarial vectors. Motivated by OpenAI
Gymnasium <a id="cite-brockman2016openai-1"></a>[\[7\]](#ref-brockman2016openai), which standardized
*training* reinforcement learning agents, we aim to provide a common way
to analyze safety, security, and privacy aspects in MASs across a
spectrum of environments. In this paper, we focus on cooperative and
general-sum formulations, more precisely, instruction-augmented
Distributed Constraint Optimization Problems (DCOPs). We target problems
that inherently require multiple agents with private data (i.e., cases
where no single, monolithic agent can solve the task simply by ingesting
all data) so that coordination and communication become key objects of
study.

We identify three key properties of MAS that enable effective
collaboration and evaluation and also enable grounds for attacks: (1) a
joint, ground-truth global objective to enable measurable impact, (2)
agents with private information and different capabilities, and (3)
complex communication patterns and trajectories. We use these properties
to guide and develop an attack framework that targets communication and
coordination: attack dimensions that do not appear in single-agent
settings.

However, to realize these properties and conduct attacks flexibly on any
part of the MAS, we require a modular and configurable agent design and
a centralized communication mechanism to inspect agents’ interactions.
For this, we revisit an early MAS design using a *blackboard*
architecture <a id="cite-erman1980hearsay-1"></a>[\[8\]](#ref-erman1980hearsay). We further identify five
key abstractions of our <span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span>
framework: agents, environment, blackboards, tools, and the
communication protocol. We implement the framework across multiple
levels: enabling different problems, communication protocols, and
providing a blackboard that accommodates persistence and modularity
through Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Our evaluation shows, first, that MAS systems achieve solid utility,
allowing LLMs to solve complex instruction-augmented DCOP problems with
sophisticated coordination; and second, that the
<span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span> enables systematic study of key
attack vectors: misalignment, data stealing, and denial-of-service. Our
framework can be extended to study new setups, attacks and defenses,
supporting further research towards trustworthy multi-agent systems.

# Background

An *agent* is typically defined as an autonomous entity that perceives
its environment and acts upon it to achieve certain
goals <a id="cite-Wooldridge2009-1"></a>[\[9\]](#ref-Wooldridge2009). A system composed of multiple
interacting agents is referred to as a *multi-agent system* (MAS). By
coordinating their actions (whether cooperatively or competitively),
agents in an MAS can solve problems that are beyond the capabilities of
any individual agent or a centrally controlled
system <a id="cite-Jennings1998-1"></a>[\[10\]](#ref-Jennings1998). The MAS paradigm, which originated
in distributed artificial intelligence, emphasizes decentralized
decision-making and has led to the development of various frameworks for
agent communication, coordination, and negotiation over the past
decades.

MAS techniques have been applied in a wide range of domains. For
example, cooperative MAS deployments include fleets of warehouse robots
coordinating storage and fulfillment <a id="cite-Wurman2008-2"></a>[\[1\]](#ref-Wurman2008),
multi-robot teams in disaster response <a id="cite-Parker1998-2"></a>[\[2\]](#ref-Parker1998), and
LLM-based search and planning agents facilitating travel
plans <a id="cite-choi2025atlas-1"></a>[\[11\]](#ref-choi2025atlas). Competitive (adversarial) MAS arise
when stakeholders have divergent objectives, e.g., defender–attacker
resource allocation modeled as Stackelberg security
games <a id="cite-Tambe2011-2"></a>[\[4\]](#ref-Tambe2011), or congestion management with selfish
agents in routing games <a id="cite-Roughgarden2005-2"></a>[\[3\]](#ref-Roughgarden2005). Despite this
breadth, many canonical MAS formalisms are computationally difficult to
solve optimally even in realistic settings—for instance, planning in
decentralized POMDPs is NEXP-complete even for finite
horizons <a id="cite-bernstein2002complexity-1"></a>[\[12\]](#ref-bernstein2002complexity), and computing Nash
equilibria in general games is
PPAD-complete <a id="cite-daskalakis2009complexity-1"></a>[\[13\]](#ref-daskalakis2009complexity). Amid this
landscape, the *distributed constraint optimization* (DCOP) framework
provides a cooperative alternative that preserves key MAS
characteristics—decentralized control, local objectives, and
communication-based coordination—while admitting scalable
exact/approximate algorithms and structure-exploiting methods for many
practical problems <a id="cite-fioretto2018survey-1"></a>[\[14\]](#ref-fioretto2018survey). Consequently, we
focus on DCOPs as the backbone for our study.

#### DCOP.

DCOPs involve a set of agents selecting local actions to maximize a
global utility, typically formulated as the sum of local utility or
constraint functions <a id="cite-fioretto2018survey-2"></a>[\[14\]](#ref-fioretto2018survey). Classical DCOP
algorithms, such as complete search (e.g.,
ADOPT) <a id="cite-modi2005adopt-1"></a>[\[15\]](#ref-modi2005adopt), message passing on pseudo-trees
(e.g., DPOP) <a id="cite-petcu2005dpop-1"></a>[\[16\]](#ref-petcu2005dpop), and local/approximate methods
(e.g., Max-Sum, DSA) <a id="cite-farinelli2008maxsum-1"></a>[\[17\]](#ref-farinelli2008maxsum),
<a id="cite-zhang2005dsa-1"></a>[\[18\]](#ref-zhang2005dsa), trade off optimality guarantees, message
and memory complexity, and anytime behavior, and they perform best when
problem structure and communication protocols are explicitly defined and
utilities are numeric and stationary. Building on this formalism, we
extend the framework with LLM-based agents. Unlike the classical DCOP
setting—where utilities are fixed symbolic functions and messages follow
engineered schemas—our agents communicate in free-form natural language,
and local constraints/objectives can be specified textually rather than
solely as hand-coded numeric functions. This preserves the DCOP backbone
while enabling systematic *security* evaluations of LLM-specific
vulnerabilities—e.g., prompt injection, communication poisoning.

#### Agent communication protocols.

Interacting agents in a MAS are required to communicate to achieve their
objectives by utilizing a communication protocol that structures the
rules and polices of communication between agents. Without this,
performance degradation, inefficient token usage, and capability loss
can emerge. Recent advancements in communication protocols such as the
Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol <a id="cite-a2aprotocolProtocol-1"></a>[\[19\]](#ref-a2aprotocolProtocol) that
assigns agent cards to specialized agents for more efficient
collaboration initialization and allows agents to communicate with each
other via messages, tools, and artifacts. Another established protocol
is the Agent Communication Protocol
(ACP) <a id="cite-githubGitHubIBMACP-1"></a>[\[20\]](#ref-githubGitHubIBMACP) which also enables
agent-to-agent communication for low-latency communication. These
protocols allow structured communication between agents and are vital to
efficient and safe MAS. However, given that most communication protocols
are developed by companies, we lack an open-source framework for testing
and benchmarking communication protocols in a controllable and isolated
environment which <span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span> satisfies.

#### Agent platforms and benchmarks.

LLM agents introduce significant security challenges such as indirect
prompt injection attacks <a id="cite-greshake2023not-1"></a>[\[21\]](#ref-greshake2023not) and context
hijacking <a id="cite-bagdasarian2024airgapagent-1"></a>[\[22\]](#ref-bagdasarian2024airgapagent).
<a id="cite-debenedetti2024agentdojo-1"></a>[\[23\]](#ref-debenedetti2024agentdojo) proposed AgentDojo, which is a
widely used dynamic environment to study agents’ security and utility
across domains such as Workspace, Travel, Slack, and Banking. Beyond
single-agent benchmarks, <a id="cite-abdelnabi2024cooperation-1"></a>[\[24\]](#ref-abdelnabi2024cooperation)
proposed a simulation benchmark for multi-agent interactive negotiation
in a non-zero-sum game setup to study cooperation and competition
dynamics. <a id="cite-abdelnabi2025firewalls-1"></a>[\[25\]](#ref-abdelnabi2025firewalls) studied security and
privacy attacks in agent-to-agent communication where an AI assistant
communicates with external parties to develop complex plans such as
travel booking. <a id="cite-petri2025-1"></a>[\[26\]](#ref-petri2025) created an auditing framework
for studying a MAS of two agents. Similarly,
<a id="cite-zhang2023building-1"></a>[\[27\]](#ref-zhang2023building) developed embodied language agents to
communicate in decentralized environments. Despite progress in this
area, we lack a canonical platform that is easily extendable,
configurable, and adaptable to study diverse multi-agent safety
challenges, which is what we propose in our work.

#### Multi-agent security.

Increased adoption of LLM-based MAS has increased concerns about their
security and privacy risks. Existing research demonstrates that known
vulnerabilities such as prompt injection <a id="cite-greshake2023not-2"></a>[\[21\]](#ref-greshake2023not)
and jailbreaking <a id="cite-anil2024many-1"></a>[\[28\]](#ref-anil2024many) manifest more severely in
multi-agent settings, where compromising a single agent enables the
attack to propagate to all others <a id="cite-lee2024prompt-1"></a>[\[29\]](#ref-lee2024prompt). Inspired
by networking security challenges, recent work has also analyzed MAS
protocols and introduced attack strategies including
Agent-in-the-Middle <a id="cite-he2025red-1"></a>[\[30\]](#ref-he2025red) and control-flow
hijacking <a id="cite-triedman2025multi-1"></a>[\[31\]](#ref-triedman2025multi). MASs have also been used to
conduct attacks, such as jailbreaks, on other
LLMs <a id="cite-abdelnabi2025firewalls-2"></a>[\[25\]](#ref-abdelnabi2025firewalls), <a id="cite-rahman2025x-1"></a>[\[32\]](#ref-rahman2025x).

#### Blackboards.

A *blackboard* is a shared, structured workspace where heterogeneous
agents post partial results, hypotheses, constraints, and goals for
others to observe, refine, or refute. Historically, blackboard systems
such as HEARSAY-II coordinated independent “knowledge sources” via a
central store and scheduler, integrating evidence across abstraction
layers to resolve uncertainty <a id="cite-Erman1980-1"></a>[\[33\]](#ref-Erman1980),
<a id="cite-Nii1986a-1"></a>[\[34\]](#ref-Nii1986a), <a id="cite-Nii1986b-1"></a>[\[35\]](#ref-Nii1986b). In our multi-agent
setting, multiple LLM-driven agents can similarly communicate and
coordinate by appending proposals, commitments, and exception notes to a
common log rather than engaging in bespoke pairwise messaging.
Contemporary realizations span tuple-space designs (Linda-style
generative communication) <a id="cite-Gelernter1985-1"></a>[\[36\]](#ref-Gelernter1985), append-only
event logs for decoupled producers/consumers <a id="cite-Kreps2011-1"></a>[\[37\]](#ref-Kreps2011),
CRDT-backed shared documents for eventual consistency
<a id="cite-Shapiro2011-1"></a>[\[38\]](#ref-Shapiro2011), and vector-indexed memories that enable
retrieval-augmented reads <a id="cite-Lewis2020-1"></a>[\[39\]](#ref-Lewis2020). Recently, works have
used the Blackboard as a communication proxy for agent-to-agent
communication to facilitate multi-agent assistance for an ego agent on
information discovery <a id="cite-salemi2025llm-1"></a>[\[40\]](#ref-salemi2025llm). However, we focus on
general decentralized multi-agent scenarios where agents are free to
communicate with each other rather than just the ego agent.

# System Properties and Use Cases

Multi-agent systems (MAS) increasingly sit in the loop of high-stakes,
data-rich applications such as coordination, scheduling, energy, and
logistics. They expose multiple attack surfaces at once: valuable
*goals* and *private objectives* that an adversary may subvert, abundant
*private data* such as user attributes, constraints, and locations, and
*communication channels* such as messages, blackboards, and tools.
LLM-driven agents amplify both capability and risk: instructions arrive
in natural language, tools are invoked via text APIs, and behaviors can
be steered or poisoned through subtle prompt-level manipulations. Our
aim is to study MAS properties against adversaries in settings that are
realistic yet evaluable.

## Problem Setup

We seek MAS problem classes that (i) admit a broad spectrum of attacks
(exfiltration, poisoning, spoofing, delay/DoS, collusion), (ii) provide
a well-defined, quantitative ground truth for evaluating success and
failure, and (iii) are implementable with LLM-based agents.

We therefore focus on following system properties:

#### Agents.

Agents are instantiated by LLMs (optionally tool-augmented), which read
natural instructions, exchange messages, and output decisions/actions.
This preserves the *agentic interface* used in practice while giving us
programmatic control over inputs, channels, and logs.

Agents participate in a cooperative task with a well-defined global
objective. A shared goal makes adversarial impact *measurable*:
subverting coordination (e.g., degraded utility, violated constraints)
becomes a scalar signal rather than anecdote. It also enables oracle
baselines (optimal or attack-free solutions) for evaluation, i.e., by
measuring task utility value gap to oracle, violation counts, regret
etc.

Each agent possesses private data, constraints, roles, tools, and
actuation. This heterogeneous private state creates a rich privacy and
security surface that enables attacks such as exfiltration,
impersonation, and capability escalation, while simultaneously
exercising the system’s access control and disclosure policies.

Agents can communicate over addressable channels—pairwise, group, and
broadcast—and across modalities such as text, structured JSON, and
images. Selective, partially private communication both opens realistic
attack vectors, including eavesdropping, spoofing, poisoning,
man-in-the-middle, and Sybil coalitions, and enables corresponding
defenses, including authentication, redundancy, and audits. Partially
private communication can also be needed in practice, e.g., between
subsets of agents who belong to the same tenant in enterprise
applications. To support realistic experiments and reproducible
analysis, the design provides per-message recipient control by the
sender, optional encryption and authentication tags, and logged
transcripts for ground-truth analysis and post-hoc forensics.

#### Problem formalization.

We now introduce a formalization of our cooperative environments,
modeled as instruction-augmented DCOPs, see
Appendix <a href="#sec:glossary" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="sec:glossary">8</a> for full notation glossary.

<div id="def:cpdcop" class="definition">

**Definition 1** (Instruction-Augmented DCOPs). An instance is a tuple
``` math
\mathcal{P}=\langle A,\ H,\ \eta,\ X,\ D,\ \sigma,\ C,\ \mu,\ o,\ \rho,\ F^\star,\ \Pi\rangle.
```

</div>

#### Objective.

Given a joint policy $`\pi=(\pi_i)_{i\in A}`$ and context $`c\sim\mu`$,
for each agent $`i`$ draw a *joint* assignment over its owned variables
$`x_{X_i}\sim \pi_i(\cdot\mid o_i(c))`$ independently across $`i`$ (or
set $`x_{X_i}=\pi_i(o_i(c))`$ if deterministic), and assemble
$`x=\big(x_v\big)_{v\in X}`$ from the collection
$`\{x_{X_i}\}_{i\in A}`$. Define the cooperative objective
``` math
F^\star(x;c)=\sum_{i\in A}\ \sum_{\beta=1}^{k_i} f_{i,\beta}^\star\big(x_{S_{i,\beta}};c\big),
```
and the optimization problem
``` math
\max_{\ \pi\in\prod_{i\in A}\Pi_i}\;
\mathbb{E}_{c\sim\mu}\ \mathbb{E}_{x\sim \pi(\cdot\mid c)}\big[\,F^\star(x;c)\,\big],
```
where $`x\sim \pi(\cdot\mid c)`$ denotes the joint assignment induced by
the agent-wise draws $`\{x_{X_i}\}_{i\in A}`$. Note that here the
$`o_i(c)`$ is private to agent $`i`$ and $`c`$ is not jointly observed
by any agents. The pair $`(X,F^\star)`$ induces a bipartite factor graph
$`G=(V_\text{var}\cup V_\text{fac},E)`$ with $`V_\text{var}=X`$,
$`V_\text{fac}=F^\star`$, and edge $`(x,f)`$ iff
$`x\in \mathrm{scope}(f)`$. Algorithms may pass messages on $`G`$; in
practice, we realize it using blackboards.

# System Design

We introduce a modular framework for evaluating the behavior, security
vulnerabilities, and safety considerations of multi-agent systems
composed of LLM-based agents. First, we enforce a well-defined, joint
goal among agents to obtain a ground-truth objective function that
allows reliable evaluation of joint agent policies in a controlled
environment. Second, our framework enables diverse collections of
agents, each with their own preferences, objectives, tools, and private
data, mimicking that of agent characteristics of multi-agent systems in
real-world scenarios. We consider the agent, environment, communication
proxy, tools, and communication protocol as key modules composing
<span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span>.

![Terrarium framework modules](dev/framework_rounded.png)

*Terrarium* is composed of multiple modules that are core to MAS communication and interaction such as
agents, environment, blackboards, the communication protocol, and tools. For instance, an agent may post
messages to a blackboard to communicate intentions and goals, call environment-dependent tools for search
and observation (e.g., reading sensors for energy monitoring) or external tools (e.g., web search), and
execute actions in the form of action tools that change the dynamics of the environment. The environment
module is an isolated and self-sustaining simulator that takes in agent actions, synchronously or
asynchronously, and gives each agent an observation (i.e., new context). To enable communication between
agents, we initialize a set of blackboards through a configurable factor graph that determines the agent
membership of each blackboard.

## Desired Properties

Given the complexity of MASs, and the need for a simple, yet aligned
framework to real-world implementations, there exist several desired
properties that should be satisfied for effective experimentation,
development, and evaluation. It is desirable to have a *modular*
framework with extensive *configurability*. These properties enable more
effective analysis on the capabilities, performance, and potential
vulnerabilities of these systems.

#### Modularity.

Multi-agent systems are often highly complex with its many
interconnected components that can overwhelm researchers, engineers, and
developers. Having an abstract framework that is simple and modular,
allowing components to be swapped, will improve the usability and
development of these systems. For example, this abstraction can enable
effective ablations and focused experimentation on specific components
for studies and analysis.

#### Configurability.

In addition to modularity, we need full configurability of each module’s
parameters and allow different configurations for diverse MAS instances
which is necessary for evaluating robustness of both performance and
vulnerabilities. For example, this allows us to stress-test specific
safety assumptions of a module and apply varying attacks to evaluate
vulnerabilities. Additionally, this level of configurability improves
reproducibility of MAS phenomena that is not as easily reproducible in
environments where even one component is uncontrolled or unconfigurable.

## Design

We account for these desired characteristics in the design of
<span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span>, where we decouple the
*agents*, *environment*, *communication proxy*, *tools*, and
*communication protocol* into distinct modules in favor of an abstract
framework that aligns with current deployments of multi-agent systems.
These properties allow fast and controlled experimentation for
multi-agent analysis, security, and safety.
Figure <a href="#fig:framework" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:framework">2</a> outlines the proposed modularity
and configurability.

<div class="wrapfigure">

![Terrarium implementation stack](dev/hourglass.png)

*Terrarium implementation stack.*


A key module of our framework is the *communication proxy* that should
enable fine-grained control and configurable observability of
communication for which we use a set of
Blackboards <a id="cite-erman1980hearsay-2"></a>[\[8\]](#ref-erman1980hearsay). Each blackboard enables
communication between two or more agents for coordination. The topology
of the blackboards are instantiated by a factor graph, which determines
the blackboard membership of agents, and implicitly controls the
communication efficiency. For example, having all agents on one
blackboard may not be efficient for communication since this could fill
an agent’s context of irrelevant conversations and information,
resulting in degradation of performance even for agents with long
context-lengths <a id="cite-liu2023lost-1"></a>[\[41\]](#ref-liu2023lost). We enable agents to have a
predefined blackboard action set, enabling complex action sequences such
as writing, erasing, referencing, reading, and highlighting. This may
extend to a continuous action space with free-form actions rather than a
discrete, token-level state space for more complex agent interaction
behavior. Although, in our implementation, we adopt an append-only
blackboard with reading and writing actions at a token-level for
simplicity.

An *environment* consists of a function that receives actions from all
agents, transitions its internal states, then sends the next state or
context to the appropriate agent. Every environment has a well-defined,
ground-truth joint objective function $`F`$ among agents which is used
to evaluate action selection quality in a cooperative setting.

The *communication protocol* contains a set of rules and structures that
organizes the communication between agents which is vital for effective
communication. We employ a simple communication protocol between agents
that facilitates planning and action phases. Each agent are tasked to
communicate intentions and goals to formulate a plan within a finite
number of steps with access to blackboard tools (e.g., get(), post()),
environment tools, and external tools to inform their decisions. Next,
agents execute an action from a set of action tools that the environment
provides which updates the transitions within the environment. Then,
agents receive an updated context or state from the environment with new
information.

Finally, *agents* are modeled as an LLM that can take actions in the
form of *tools* using model context protocol
(MCP) <a id="cite-hou2025model-1"></a>[\[42\]](#ref-hou2025model) with
FastMCP <a id="cite-githubGitHubJlowinfastmcp-1"></a>[\[43\]](#ref-githubGitHubJlowinfastmcp). From here, we have
full control over the capabilities of the agents, their personalities,
and internal objectives by using a layered stack as in
Figure <a href="#fig:communication_stack" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:communication_stack">[fig:communication_stack]</a>.
Similar to how Wireshark <a id="cite-wireshark-1"></a>[\[44\]](#ref-wireshark) allows studying
different networking protocols at different layers of the networking
stack, <span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span> can be configured to
support different backbone servers, configuration formats, communication
protocols, and use-cases while connecting them through the blackboard
primitives outlined in
Figure <a href="#fig:framework" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="fig:framework">2</a>.

# Safety and Security

The interaction between agents during collaboration requires extensive
information sharing to provide sufficient context for solving tasks.
These conversations are facilitated by protocols specifically designed
for multi-agent communication. However, the method, volume, and nature
of information exchange introduce new challenges related to security,
privacy, and system robustness.

The modular and flexible design of
<span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span> enables systematic exploration
of these challenges. Its configurability allows us to easily construct
attack scenarios, while its modularity supports the creation of
adversarial agents with diverse capabilities across different
environments. Furthermore, its observability enables implementing and
measuring Attack Success Rate (ASR) metrics.

## Unsafe and Insecure Characteristics

A successful multi-agent design requires system and collaboration
strategies with characteristics unique to a MAS, which adversaries can
exploit to construct a range of attacks. Such attacks, leveraging these
and other MAS-specific features, may have catastrophic effects on the
system as the compromise propagates through multiple interactions.

In a collaborative environment, agents typically assume that the actions
of others are intended to optimize the global objective. However,
verifying that an agent’s actions are not instead serving a secondary,
unintentional or adversarial, objective may not be feasible. This
creates unique challenges, as a large number of potential secondary
objectives can be pursued through actions that still appear valid. The
ulterior motive can range from targeting a specific goal or agent to
misaligning and affecting the performance of the entire system.

To take actions and retrieve necessary information, agents must rely on
external tools, extending their capabilities. These tools can be
leveraged for both active attacks, where the adversary modifies the
interaction to carry out the attack, and passive attacks, where the
adversary observes the interaction to infer information. While
multi-agent poisoning has been studied in limited contexts, such as
poisoning via web-retrieved content <a id="cite-lee2024prompt-2"></a>[\[29\]](#ref-lee2024prompt), the
growing scale and complexity of MAS systems—and their increasing
reliance on heterogeneous tool sets—introduce novel challenges.

MASs are dependent on communication protocols for effective
collaboration. These underlying protocols connect agents to one another
and, in many cases, to central platforms that coordinate their
interactions <a id="cite-dang2025multi-1"></a>[\[45\]](#ref-dang2025multi),
<a id="cite-bhatt2025should-1"></a>[\[46\]](#ref-bhatt2025should). As these protocols rapidly evolve and
form the core of modern MASs, it becomes essential to study the novel
attack vectors that emerge from their integration.

## Exploring Attack Vectors

The characteristics specified in the previous section motivate us to
explore novel attack vectors to test the Confidentiality, Integrity and
Availability (CIA) of MASs. We use these attack vectors to understand
the security and privacy implications of MASs and to motivate future
research.

To evaluate confidentiality, we examine whether agents preserve private
information communicated by a previous agent when interacting with a
subsequent one. In this setup, the second agent is instructed to elicit
the personal information shared earlier, while the queried agent
receives a system prompt explicitly stating that it should not reveal
private information about any other agent. Our findings show that the
*agent nevertheless discloses the information, despite being prompted
not to*.

To evaluate integrity, we examine misalignment by determining which
actions, and the minimum number of actions, must be altered by an
adversary during collaboration. We investigate two scenarios: an
adversarial agent part of the collaboration and an external adversary
capable of poisoning communication. The adversarial agent is restricted
to modifying messages on its blackboard and communicating its own
preferences, whereas the external adversary can target any agent,
action, or blackboard. Our results indicate that (1) *a single
adversarial agent is sufficient to misalign the entire system*, and (2)
*an external adversary can induce misalignment in one shot with access
to a single planning round, though multiple shots are required to
improve efficacy*.

In collaborative settings, agents expend significant tokens and maintain
extensive context windows to retain the history of prior interactions,
which informs future decisions. We were able to carry out the
availability attacks at only a fraction of the cost required for
completing the underlying task. These findings suggest that *MASs are
particularly vulnerable to context overflow attacks, with attack costs
diminishing as additional agents participate*.

# Experiments

To evaluate the performance of the attacks, we first measure the
joint-utility of the agents on the three given tasks. We use difference
in utility as the primary measure of misalignment success, since
misalignment impacts the ability of the agent to contribute to the joint
goal. We measure privacy by comparing the actual private information to
the retrieved information with LLM-as-a-judge. We assign a accuracy
score of 100% if the LLM states the retrieved information is fully
accurate, 50% if it is partially accurate, and 0% if it is inaccurate.
We report the context overflow attack success rate (ASR) by measuring
the number of times, out of 30 seeded runs, the attack causes an API
error.

## Driving Use Cases

We adopt three instruction-augmented
DCOPs <a id="cite-mahmud2025collab-1"></a>[\[5\]](#ref-mahmud2025collab),
<a id="cite-mahmud2025distributed-1"></a>[\[6\]](#ref-mahmud2025distributed) that span environments generated
from synthetic and real-world data. Each environment holds a
ground-truth joint-utility function and a well-defined action space.

Meeting Scheduling is a partially-generated real-world environment where
agents are attendees; decision variables are meetings
$`\mathcal{X}=\{x_m\}`$ with discrete slots
$`\mathcal{D}_{x_m}=\{0,\ldots,9\}`$ (1-hour blocks). Each meeting has
an *owner* (one of its attendees). The context $`c`$ provides a
per-meeting mode $`\{\textsc{Physical},\textsc{Zoom}\}`$ and building
coordinates for physical meetings. For each agent $`i`$, $`I_i`$
specifies (a) preferred slots $`P_{i,m}\subseteq\{0,\ldots,9\}`$ for
each meeting $`m`$ they attend, and (b) a strict priority
$`\pi_i(m)\in\mathbb{N}`$ over their meetings. Optionally, $`I_i`$
includes a visual panel that *mirrors* the textual fields: a graph-based
campus map (nodes are buildings placed at coordinates from $`c`$, edges
labeled by integer minute distances) and a simple 10-slot strip per
meeting highlighting the agent’s preferred slots $`P_{i,m}`$; the visual
adds no scoring fields beyond what $`P_{i,m}`$ and $`c`$ already convey.
For the joint-utility score, Meeting ranges from $`[0, \infty]`$ with a
higher score being more successful.

PersonalAssistant is a fully synthetic environment where each agent
$`i`$ chooses an outfit $`x_i`$ from a wardrobe; an outfit is object
that contains following attributes
$`(\text{article}, \text{color}, \text{optional image})`$. The
interaction graph induces color-based factors: unary
<span class="smallcaps">PREF_COLOR</span>/<span class="smallcaps">AVOID_COLOR</span>
and pairwise
<span class="smallcaps">MATCH_COLOR</span>/<span class="smallcaps">NOT_MATCH_COLOR</span>.
Only *color* affects scoring (articles/images are presentation only).
$`I_i`$ is text specifying the agent’s color likes/dislikes and neighbor
cues (e.g., “match Alice,” “do not match Bob”) and the description of
the outfits in the wardrobe. An optional *visual panel* mirrors the text
description of the wardrobe: a per-agent collage of their wardrobe
options. For the joint-utility score, PersonalAssistant ranges from
$`[0,1]`$ with a higher score being more successful.

SmartHome is fully generated with real-world meter data where agents are
smart-home assistants (one per home). Each home has several tasks; for
each task the agent selects a start time $`x_{h,j}`$ from its
*allowed-start* set. The context $`c`$ provides a time-varying
sustainable capacity profile $`S[t]`$. When aggregate demand exceeds
$`S[t]`$ at slot $`t`$, the excess is supplied by the
main—unsustainable—grid. A single high-arity factor couples all homes
through this main-grid draw. For each home $`h`$, $`I_h`$ enumerates its
tasks with energy *consumption* (kW), *duration* (slots), and the
*allowed* start times used by the scorer. An optional visual panel
*mirrors* the same information: a top bar chart of $`S[t]`$ over the
horizon and, below, per-task horizontal segments marking allowed start
windows. For the joint-utility score, SmartHome ranges from
$`[-\infty, 0]`$ with a higher score being more successful.

## Experimental Setup

In our experiments, we use seeded, randomized configurations of each
environment, varying transition dynamics, factor graph initialization,
number of agents, preferences, and constraints. To exhibit complex
communication, we simulate 6 agents for PersonalAssistant, 10 agents for
Meeting, and 8 agents for SmartHome.

## Experiments

Table <a href="#tab:baselines" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:baselines">[tab:baselines]</a> reports the
normalized joint objective value, $`F_{\textsc{POST}}`$ across three
models and three DCOP domains, which we use as the baseline for our
attack experiments in
Table <a href="#tab:CIA_results" data-reference-type="ref"
data-reference="tab:CIA_results">[tab:CIA_results]</a>. We normalize
$`F`$ using min-max normalization by using the lowerbound over the
minimum possible scores for each seed instance and the upperbound over
the maximum possible scores where min and max values are obtained using
search. We find that smaller models such as OpenAI GPT-4.1-nano are
often unable to assign actions to all their agent-owned variables (e.g.,
meeting time slots, outfit, or energy time slots), causing incomplete
evaluations which are filtered out in the calculation of the
joint-utility values.

To study the different attacks, we adopt GPT-4.1-mini as our primary
model and focus on meeting scheduling for evaluations. We evaluate
communication poisoning under varying numbers of poisoning shots to
analyze the correlation between increased poisoning and misalignment.
Our results show that in the privacy attack, the adversary was able to
query the model and retrieve details with 100% accuracy. We also
successfully conducted context overflow attacks with 100% accuracy. This
shows MASs can be highly vulnerable to privacy and availability attacks.

Although we consistently observe a decrease in utility under adversarial
agent and communication poisoning attacks, the reduction is not
significant—indicating that while these attacks succeed, their impact
remains relatively weak. However, we do observe that increasing the
number of shots leads to higher attack efficacy, showing a clear
correlation between poisoning percentage and attack success.

# Conclusion

We introduce a simple, abstract framework,
<span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span>, for studying behavior,
alignment, and security of multi-agent systems (MAS) in a controlled and
scalable environment. Our design is modular and extendable, allowing the
study of key attack vectors that MASs deployed in the real-world could
be exposed to: malicious agents, compromised communications, and
misaligned goals.

This framework can enable studying agents in controlled and isolated
environments. It may be useful for designing and optimizing defenses and
mitigations, but its simplistic design is not meant for deployment due
to optimizations likely required in the communication protocol and
communication proxy for memory and computational efficiency such as
minimizing the memory an context utilization in blackboards. In future
work, we plan to explore other MAS environments that involve competition
and negotiation, opening up new attack vectors tied to self-interested
agents and potential defense mechanisms.

# Ethical Consideration

<span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span> enables analysis of complex
attack vectors on multi-agent systems, further advancing our
understanding of how to deploy MAS in the real world. We do not use any
real user data, nor study deployed systems, instead focusing on creating
an isolated environment similar to how
Wireshark <a id="cite-wireshark-2"></a>[\[44\]](#ref-wireshark) enables studying network security. We
hope that our framework will enable development of new defenses and
mitigation methods under various scenarios and provide a necessary
playground to isolate and inspect the attacks.

# Reproducibility Statement

We ensure reproducibility by committing to release the full
<span class="smallcaps">Terrarium</span> framework including
configurations, results, and logs. Experiments were conducted with
OpenAI backbones through official APIs. Detailed instructions, including
environment setup and scripts to regenerate all tables/figures, will be
provided in the project repository for the camera-ready version.

# DCOP glossary

We use $`i\in A`$ for agents, $`\alpha`$ for factor indices, $`x\in X`$
for decision variables, $`S_\alpha\subseteq X`$ for a factor scope,
$`c\in C`$ for context, $`z_i=o_i(c)`$ for agent-$`i`$’s local context,
$`X_i=\{x\in X:\sigma(x)=i\}`$ for the set of variables controlled by
agent $`i`$, $`x_{X_i}\in\prod_{x\in X_i} D_x`$ for agent-$`i`$’s joint
decision, and $`x\in\prod_{x\in X} D_x`$ for a global assignment.

- $`A`$: finite set of agents, e.g., $`A=\{1,\dots,n\}`$.

- $`H`$: set of humans.

- Let $`\eta:A\to 2^{H}\setminus\{\varnothing\}`$ be the mapping
  function indicating the nonempty set of humans it serves, allowing
  multiple humans to share an agent and any human to control many
  agents. This pairing induces a many-to-many control structure that
  routes instructions and constraints, shaping how the underlying
  problem is partitioned and coordinated across agents.

- $`X`$: set of *decision variables* (an agent may control zero, one, or
  many variables).

- $`D`$: per-variable finite domains,
  $`D=\{D_x\subset\mathbb{X}_x:\ x\in X\}`$ with $`x\in D_x`$.

- $`\sigma`$: ownership map $`\sigma:X\to A`$; for each agent $`i`$,
  define $`X_i=\{x\in X:\sigma(x)=i\}`$.

- $`C`$: (global) *context* space; realizations denoted $`c\in C`$.

- $`\mu`$: reference distribution on $`C`$ used for context-averaged
  objectives.

- $`o`$: local context observation maps $`o=\{o_i:C\to Z_i\}_{i\in A}`$;
  agent $`i`$ observes $`z_i=o_i(c)`$.

- $`\rho`$: instruction renderer
  $`\rho:\big(F_i^\star,c\big)\mapsto I_i`$ in some modality (e.g.,
  text/image). Agents observe $`I_i`$ (and possibly $`z_i`$), not
  $`F_i^\star`$.

- $`F^\star`$: ground-truth *local utilities* (asymmetric
  factorization). For each agent $`i`$ there is a finite set
  $`F_i^\star=\{f_{i,\beta}^\star\}_{\beta=1}^{k_i}`$ with scopes
  $`S_{i,\beta}\subseteq X`$ and
  ``` math
  f_{i,\beta}^\star:\Big(\prod_{v\in S_{i,\beta}} D_v\Big)\times C\ \to\ \mathbb{R},\qquad
        (x_{S_{i,\beta}},c)\ \mapsto\ f_{i,\beta}^\star(x_{S_{i,\beta}};c).
  ```
  The union $`F^\star=\bigcup_{i\in A}F_i^\star`$ is the set of all
  factors.

- $`\Pi`$: policy classes, one per agent, $`\Pi=\{\Pi_i\}_{i\in A}`$. A
  (possibly randomized) policy $`\pi_i\in\Pi_i`$ maps local context to a
  *joint* distribution over the variables agent $`i`$ controls:
  ``` math
  \pi_i: Z_i \to \Delta\!\Big(\prod_{x\in X_i} D_x\Big),\qquad
        x_{X_i} \sim \pi_i(\cdot\mid z_i),\ \ z_i=o_i(c).
  ```
  Deterministic policies are the special case
  $`\pi_i(z_i)\in \prod_{x\in X_i} D_x`$.
